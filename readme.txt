### NEW: Switching service

### Outsource your printing to streetshirts

* __100% White Label__ - Your orders are dispatched directly to your customers in plain packaging so they don't know we are involved.

* __State of the art print quality__ - We only use direct-to-garment printing machines from the most premium brand, designed for demanding industrial use. Your products will be high-street quality.

* __Discounted__ - We offer a 2.50 discount per item initially, rising to 4.00 per item for very large volumes. This means shirts from £4.33 + VAT including printing.

* __The Fastest In Europe__ - We have large stocks of blank garments, so the vast majority of your orders will be in the post the same day we receive them. This fast service will translate directly into increased sales for your brand.

* __Print On Demand__ - We only print once you've sold the item, so no large orders or keeping stock.

* __UK Based__ - We print every order from our base in Lincolnshire, so no hassle with import duty, international postage or slow shipping to your customers.

* __Pay As You Go__ - Quickly Top-up online, your balance is reduced as you send orders through.

### How does it work

* Install our plug-in
* Create your products using our [T-Shirt Design Software](http://www.streetshirts.co.uk/design-your-own-t-shirts).
* Click to add the product to WooCommerce (all variants are created for you automatically).
* Once you have an order, one-click sends it to us for fulfillment. Or, turn on 'Auto-Send' to leave you free to concentrate on other things.
* We'll mark the order shipped in shopify and update your customer automatically once the shirt has been dispatched.

### Pricing and profit

Prices start from £4.33 + VAT per shirt, and prices depend on volume. The seller service works by offering a percentage discount on the prices in the 'Create & Buy T-Shirts' section of our site. A full price list is shown in the plugin.

### Product range

Our product range can be seen on the [Create & Buy T-Shirts](http://www.streetshirts.co.uk/design-your-own-t-shirts) section of our website.

### Capacity

Our production capacity means we can offer the fastest white-label t-shirt printing in the UK. We work 24/7 at peak times meaning we can dispatch 4,000 items per day.

80% of all orders are dispatched from stock; we print and post the SAME DAY as the item is ordered.

### Print quality

Streetshirts is one of the UK's leading Direct On Garment printers with the capacity to print 1000s of items each day.

We currently run 7 Kornit DTG printers (including the new Hexa R2) and 2 huge dryers. Our prints are soft to touch, 100% organic, and 100% safe for children and infants.

The prints are ink-based and form part of the garment rather than being printed on top, so the print feels soft and stretches with with shirt. Washed normally the print will last as long as the garment. You can even tumble-dry.

### Streetshirts Is

* __Responsible to our employees__ - We pay all of our staff and contractors in excess of the Living Wage and we are an accredited Living Wage Employer

* __Responsible to the wider community__ - We have an annual fund to sponsor charitable work for good causes.

* __Responsible to the environment__ - Our print process is 100% non-toxic and produces no harmful waste.

* __Responsible to the planet__ - We are a carbon-neutral company. We reduce, recycle or reuse all we can, and offset those emissions we can't.
